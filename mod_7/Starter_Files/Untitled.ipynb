    "It looks as though there are several instances that could potetionally be hacks on both user's credit cards. I came to this conclusion because I have found a few transactions that were less than $2 sporadically in 2018. cardholder 18 has about 18 transactions that should be flagged as potetial fraud, where as cardholder 2 has about 10. I have created a couple graphs to help you visualize, and know which dates these transactions took place. "
